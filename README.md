## Screeps

https://screeps.com

Screeps is a real time strategy game where you control your units writing code.

The code is pushed to a MMO server where it runs for an specific amount of time determined by your CPU bucket allowance.

#### How do I win

The goal of this game is conquer as much as possible while defending from other real players.
To achive it you code must be efficient, otherwhise the actions (move, attack, search, build, ...) wont be completed on time and you'll get stuck.

I'm creating multiple roles to manage the different actions and optimized the search functions (very resource intensive), the more you expand the harder it becomes to control everything (you have more tasks to do but the same CPU resoures).
